# Minesweeper-logic_only
 This is a minesweeper solver written in python that can solve some cases that don't require any guesses

a "?" means an unkown space, which may or may not be a bomb.
a "." means an empty space, which as you may havev guessed, doesn't contain anything.
a number tells you how many bombs are in the 8 spaces directly around the cell it is located in.
